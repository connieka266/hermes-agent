"""WAL-keeper regression: the driver's poll loop must not let SQLite delete the
state.db -wal/-shm sidecars on ephemeral open/close cycles.

Root cause (observed in production, Sep 2026): the 5 s idle poll opens and
closes the DB on every cycle. Each close makes SQLite believe it is the last
connection, so it unlinks the sidecars — stranding peer processes holding
long-lived connections on a deleted shm generation (split wal-index). The
driver now holds one persistent keeper connection for the supervisor's
lifetime: while any connection is open, SQLite never deletes the sidecars on
another connection's close.
